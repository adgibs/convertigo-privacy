# Privacy Policy for Convertify

**Last Updated: February 5, 2026**

## Overview

Convertify ("the App") is developed by Andrew G. This privacy policy explains how the App handles your information.

## Data Collection

**Convertify does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

The App:
- Does NOT require an account or login
- Does NOT collect usage analytics
- Does NOT use third-party tracking services
- Does NOT access your contacts, location, or photos
- Does NOT connect to the internet for core functionality

## Data Storage

All data stays on your device:
- **Conversion History**: Stored locally on your device only
- **Favorites**: Stored locally on your device only
- **Custom Conversions**: Stored locally on your device only

This data is never transmitted to any server or third party.

## Third-Party Services

The App contains a link to Ko-fi (ko-fi.com) for optional donations. If you choose to visit this link, Ko-fi's privacy policy will apply. This is entirely optional and the App functions fully without it.

## Children's Privacy

Convertify does not collect any data from anyone, including children under 13.
